## Assessment Philosophy

This mixed activities approach recognizes that students learn differently and excel in various formats:

- **Quick Quiz** - Tests foundational knowledge retention
- **Hands-On Lab** - Develops practical configuration skills
- **Video Demo** - Builds communication and tutorial creation abilities
- **Research Project** - Encourages critical thinking and technology evaluation
- **Code Review** - Develops collaborative development practices
- **Creative Challenge** - Fosters innovation and problem-solving creativity

## Resources & Support

### Getting Help
- **Office Hours:** Tuesday/Thursday 2-4 PM
- **Discussion Forum:** Post questions for peer and instructor help
- **Study Groups:** Self-organized collaborative learning sessions
- **Technical Support:** Framework-specific troubleshooting assistance

### Additional Resources
- [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
- [Framework Architecture Deep Dive](../../framework_documentation/01_core_concepts/)
- [Video Tutorials Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist/framework-tutorials)
- [Community Examples Repository](https://github.com/framework-examples/)

### Assessment Timeline

```
Week 1: Quiz + Config Lab Due
Week 2: Video Demo + Research Presentation
Week 3: Code Review + Creative Challenge
```

**Pro Tip:** Start the creative challenge early - it's the most time-intensive but also the most rewarding activity! ðŸŽ¯

Good luck, and remember: the goal is deep understanding, not just completion. Focus on learning through doing, and don't hesitate to experiment and break things along the way!
