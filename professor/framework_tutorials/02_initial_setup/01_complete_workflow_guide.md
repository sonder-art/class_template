## üéì STUDENT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. **Go to the class repository** (your instructor will provide the link)
   - Example: `https://github.com/instructor-username/class_template`
2. **Click the "Fork" button** (top right of the page)
3. **Choose your GitHub account** as the destination
4. **Wait for the fork to complete** (GitHub will redirect you to your fork)

**You now have**: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/class_template`

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/class_template.git

# Go into the repository folder
cd class_template
```

**What this does:** Downloads your copy of the repository to your computer so you can work on it.

### Step 3: Set Upstream Remote (Connect to Instructor)
This connects your fork to the instructor's original repository so you can get updates:

```bash
# Replace INSTRUCTOR-USERNAME with your instructor's GitHub username
git remote add upstream https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR-USERNAME/class_template.git

# Verify it worked (you should see 'origin' and 'upstream')
git remote -v
```

**You should see:**
```
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/class_template.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/class_template.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR-USERNAME/class_template.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR-USERNAME/class_template.git (push)
```

### Step 4: Get Latest Updates from Instructor
Before starting, get any updates your instructor may have made:

```bash
# Fetch all updates from instructor
git fetch upstream

# Merge instructor's changes into your main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

**What this does:** Ensures you have the latest content and framework before you start working.

### Step 5: Run the Student Setup Script
This creates your personal student directory and sets everything up:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the repository root (you should see 'students/' folder)
ls

# Run the setup script with YOUR GitHub username
./students/start.sh YOUR-USERNAME
```

**Example:** If your GitHub username is `alice`:
```bash
./students/start.sh alice
```

**What you'll see:**
```
üöÄ Setting up student directory for: alice
üìÅ Creating directory structure...
üìã Copying configuration files...
üìö Creating content directories...
üîÑ Running initial sync...
‚öôÔ∏è Generating Hugo configuration...
‚úÖ Setup complete! Your directory is ready at students/alice/
```

### Step 6: Navigate to Your Directory
```bash
# Go to your student directory
cd students/YOUR-USERNAME

# Example: cd students/alice
```

**Important:** From now on, you'll work inside this directory. This is YOUR space in the repository.

### Step 7: Sync Framework and Build Your Site
Use the management script to sync the latest framework and build your site:

```bash
# Sync framework from professor (gets latest tools/themes)
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --sync

# Build your website
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build
```

**What you'll see:**
```
üîÑ Syncing framework from professor...
‚úÖ Framework sync complete!

üèóÔ∏è Building Hugo site...
‚úÖ Site built successfully!
üìç Output: framework_code/hugo_generated/
```

### Step 8: View Your Website
Start a local web server to see your site:

```bash
# Serve your site locally
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --dev
```

**What you'll see:**
```
üöÄ Starting development server...
üìç Your site is available at: http://localhost:1314
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:1314` to see your website!

### Step 9: Add Your First Content
Create your first note or assignment:

```bash
# Create a new file in your class notes
# Use any text editor (VS Code, Sublime, even Notepad)
nano class_notes/01_my_first_note.md
```

Add this content:
```markdown
---
title: "My First Note"
type: "note"
date: "2025-01-20"
author: "Your Name"
summary: "This is my first note in the class"
---

# My First Note

This is my first note! I can write:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`

## Math (if LaTeX is enabled)
When LaTeX is working: $E = mc^2$

## Python Code
```python
print("Hello, class!")
```

Great! I'm ready to learn.
```

### Step 10: Rebuild and View Changes
```bash
# Build again to see your changes
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build

# Refresh your browser to see the new content
```

### Step 11: Save Your Work (Commit and Push)
When you're happy with your changes:

```bash
# Go back to repository root
cd ../../

# Add your changes
git add students/YOUR-USERNAME/

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add my first note and personal setup"

# Push to your fork on GitHub
git push origin main
```

**What this does:** Saves your work to GitHub so it's backed up and can be deployed.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ PROFESSOR WORKFLOW

### Step 1-4: Same as Students
Follow the same fork ‚Üí clone ‚Üí upstream ‚Üí fetch process above.

### Step 5: Configure Course Information
Edit the course configuration files:

```bash
# Edit course information
nano professor/course.yml
```

Update these key fields:
```yaml
course_name: "Your Actual Course Name"
course_code: "CS101"  # Your course code
semester: "Spring 2025"  # Current semester

professor:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "your.email@university.edu"
  office_hours: "MW 2-4pm"
  office_location: "Room 123"

resources:
  repository: "github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/class_template"
```

### Step 6: Build and Test Professor Site
```bash
cd professor

# Build the site
python3 framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build

# Test locally
python3 framework_code/scripts/manage.py --dev
```

Open `http://localhost:1313` to see your course site.

### Step 7: Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
# From professor directory
python3 framework_code/scripts/manage.py --deploy

# Or build and commit manually
git add .
git commit -m "Configure course for Spring 2025"
git push origin main
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Script Reference

The `manage.py` script has several useful flags:

### Status and Information
```bash
# Check current status
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --status

# Example output:
# üìä Repository Status
# üèóÔ∏è Build Status: Ready (hugo.toml exists)
# üìÅ Content: 12 files across 3 directories
# üïí Last build: 2 minutes ago
```

### Building and Development
```bash
# Build site only
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build

# Build and start development server
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build --dev

# Start dev server without building
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --dev
```

### Syncing (Students only)
```bash
# Sync framework from professor
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --sync

# Check what would be synced (dry run)
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --sync --status
```

### Validation and Cleanup
```bash
# Validate content and configuration
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --validate

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Permission denied" on setup script
```bash
chmod +x students/start.sh
./students/start.sh YOUR-USERNAME
```

### "Command not found: python3"
Try just `python`:
```bash
python professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --build
```

### "Port already in use" (1313 or 1314)
```bash
# Kill any existing Hugo servers
pkill hugo

# Or use different port
python3 professor/framework_code/scripts/manage.py --dev --port 8080
```

### Hugo not installed
See [Hugo Installation Guide](../A_github_hugo_terminal_commands/01_terminal_flags_quick_reference.md) for your operating system.

### Git upstream issues
```bash
# Remove and re-add upstream
git remote remove upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR-USERNAME/class_template.git
```

### "Nothing to commit" but you made changes
Make sure you're in the right directory and added files:
```bash
# Check your current location
pwd

# Check what changed
git status

# Add specific files or directories
git add students/YOUR-USERNAME/
```
