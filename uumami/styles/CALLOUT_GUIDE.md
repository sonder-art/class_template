# Common Patterns

## Lesson Structure Pattern
```markdown
::: {.callout-objective}
**Today's Goals**: Learn Git basics and create your first repository.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Version control is like a time machine for your code...
:::

::: {.callout-definition}
**Git**: A distributed version control system...
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Use `git status` frequently to see what's happening...
:::

::: {.callout-exercise}
Let's practice: Create your first Git repository...
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Never commit passwords or sensitive data...
:::

::: {.callout-homework}
For next week, complete the Git tutorial...
:::
```

## AI-Enhanced Learning Pattern
```markdown
::: {.callout-prompt title="Getting Started with AI"}
"You are a Python tutor. Help me understand variables by explaining them using real-world analogies. Include examples."
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
When the AI explains something you don't understand, ask follow-up questions like "Can you explain that differently?" or "Show me an example."
:::

::: {.callout-exercise}
Try the prompt above, then ask the AI to create practice problems for you to solve.
:::
```

## Troubleshooting Pattern
```markdown
::: {.callout-warning}
If you see "command not found" errors, Python might not be installed correctly.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Quick Fix"}
Try `python3 --version` to check if Python is installed. If not, revisit the installation guide.

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Think of an API like a restaurant menu ‚Äì it shows you what you can order (request) and what you'll get back (response), but you don't need to know how the kitchen (server) actually makes the food.
:::

::: {.callout-prompt}
"Explain APIs using the restaurant analogy but for a weather app. How does the app get weather data?"
:::
```
