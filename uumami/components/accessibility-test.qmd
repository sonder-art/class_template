# Testing OpenDyslexic Accessibility

This page demonstrates the automatic dyslexia-friendly font system with navbar integration.

## Look for the Accessibility Toggle!

**In the Navbar:** Look for "ðŸ”¤ Dyslexic" in the top navigation next to the GitHub icon!

- **Desktop:** Shows "ðŸ”¤ Dyslexic" with full text
- **Mobile:** Shows just "ðŸ”¤" icon to save space
- **All Devices:** Click the checkbox to toggle dyslexic-friendly fonts

## Different Text Elements

### Regular Paragraph Text
This is normal paragraph text that should change to OpenDyslexic when the toggle is enabled. The font is specifically designed to help people with dyslexia by using weighted bottoms and unique character shapes.

### Code Examples
Here's some `inline code` and a code block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "This code should also use OpenDyslexic"
```

### Lists and Content
- This is a bullet point
- Another item in the list
- All text should change consistently

1. Numbered lists work too
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Callout Examples

::: {.callout-note}
This is a note callout. The text inside should change to OpenDyslexic when the accessibility toggle is enabled.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Pro Tip"}
This tip callout should also use the dyslexic-friendly font when enabled, making it easier for students with dyslexia to read important advice.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Warning callouts are important for safety. Making them accessible ensures all students can read critical information.

## Testing Instructions

### All Screen Sizes:
1. **Find the toggle** - Look in the navbar next to the GitHub icon
2. **Desktop** - Should see "ðŸ”¤ Dyslexic" with text
3. **Mobile** - Should see just "ðŸ”¤" icon
4. **Toggle the font** - Check the checkbox to switch to OpenDyslexic
5. **Test persistence** - Refresh page and navigate - setting should persist

### What to Look For:
- **OpenDyslexic ON**: Letters have thick bottoms and unique character shapes
- **Regular fonts OFF**: Returns to theme fonts (Evangelion, Cyberpunk, etc.)

## Site-Wide Setup

To add this to your entire website, add this to your `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    include-after-body: accessibility-auto.html
```

The accessibility system works seamlessly across all themes!
