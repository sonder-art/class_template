## üìç Where You Are

This is Step 1 of the setup process. You're creating accounts for AI tools that will help you throughout the course.

## Your Team of AI Assistants

::: {.definition title="What is an AI Assistant?"}
An AI assistant (or Large Language Model) is a powerful computer program designed to understand and generate human-like text. Think of it as a super-smart chatbot that has read a massive portion of the internet.

You can ask it questions in plain English, have it explain complex topics, help you brainstorm, write code, find bugs, and much more. It's like having a team of experts on call 24/7 to help you learn and create.
:::

Modern programming and data analysis are rarely done alone. In the past, you might have had to rely on a textbook or a single instructor. Today, you have access to a suite of powerful AI assistants that are like having a team of experts and a massive, interactive library available to you 24/7.

We are having you sign up for several because, just like people, each AI has different strengths. You will learn which one to ask for different types of questions.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Use Your University Email**

When possible, sign up for these services using your university email address. Many services offer free educational plans or additional credits for students.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Protect Your Privacy"}
These AI models learn from the conversations you have. **Never share private or sensitive information** with them, such as passwords, personal identification, or confidential data. Treat every chat as if it were public.
