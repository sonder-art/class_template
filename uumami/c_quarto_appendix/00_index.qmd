## Welcome to the Quarto Crash Course!

In the first appendix, you installed all the necessary tools and confirmed they work. Now, it's time to truly learn how to use the most powerful tool in your new workshop: **Quarto**.

Think of Quarto as a "publishing house" for your ideas. You provide the raw manuscript in a simple format (text and code), and Quarto, as the publisher, handles everything else—layout, styling, code execution, and formatting—to produce a beautiful and professional final product, whether it's a website, a PDF report, or a presentation.

This appendix is a crash course designed to make you a confident Quarto user.

## Your Roadmap

Here is the path you will follow. We recommend completing the chapters in order, as each one builds upon the last.
