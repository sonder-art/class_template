## The Two Languages of a Quarto Document

Every `.qmd` file you create is written using two simple "languages." Understanding them is the key to unlocking everything else.

1.  **Markdown:** This is the language you use to write your actual content—the text, images, and links. It's designed to be easy to read and write.
2.  **YAML:** This is a simple configuration language you use in the header of the file to give instructions to Quarto, like setting a title or theme.

Let's look at each one.

## Part 1: Markdown - The Language of Content

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text. Here are the most common elements you'll use every day.

### Headers
Use hash symbols (`#`) to create section and sub-section headers.

```markdown
# This is a Main Header (Level 1)
## This is a Sub-Header (Level 2)
### This is a smaller header (Level 3)
```

### Emphasis
Create bold or italic text using asterisks.

```markdown
This is *italic text*.
This is **bold text**.
This is ***bold and italic text***.
```

### Lists
You can create bulleted (unordered) or numbered (ordered) lists.

```markdown
* An item in a bulleted list
* Another item

1. The first step
2. The second step
```

### Links and Images
Use square brackets and parentheses to create links and images.

```markdown
A link to [the Quarto website](https://quarto.org).

An image: ![A cute animal](./path/to/image.jpg)
```

## Part 2: YAML - The Control Panel

The block of text at the very top of a `.qmd` file, enclosed in `---`, is the YAML header. Think of this as the "control panel" or "settings screen" for your document. It doesn't appear in the final output, but it gives Quarto crucial instructions.

```yaml
---
title: "My Document's Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: "today"
format: html
---
```

-   `title`, `author`, `date`: These are simple keys that tell Quarto what to display at the top of your rendered page.
-   `format`: This tells Quarto what kind of output you want. `html` is the default for websites.

You will learn many more YAML options in the upcoming chapters.

## Thinking with AI: Mastering the Basics

Forgetting syntax is normal. Your AI assistant is the perfect tool to help you.

### AI Prompting for Markdown & YAML

**Scenario 1: You forgot some syntax.**
> "You are a Markdown expert. I need to create a table with 3 columns (Name, Role, Project) and 2 rows of example data. Can you show me the correct Markdown syntax for this?"

**Scenario 2: You want to format messy notes.**
> "Act as a document formatter. Take the following messy text and structure it logically using Markdown headers, lists, and bold text to improve readability."
> (Paste your messy text here)

**Scenario 3: You want to know what a YAML option does.**
> "You are a Quarto expert. In a Quarto YAML header, what does the `toc: true` option do? Can you explain it and give me a simple example?"
