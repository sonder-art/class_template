## What is Gitpod?

::: {.callout-tip}
### The Cloud Development Environment
Think of Gitpod as a powerful computer that lives on the internet. It comes with all the software we need for this course pre-installed. You access it through your web browser, so you don't need to install anything on your own machine.

This is a fantastic option if:
-   You have a Chromebook or tablet.
-   You are having trouble with the local installation on your computer.
-   You want to get started immediately without any setup.

Using Gitpod is **not** a lesser option; it is a professional tool used by developers at major companies like Google and Shopify.

## How to Get Started with Gitpod

### Step 1: Create a Gitpod Account

1.  Go to [https://www.gitpod.io/](https://www.gitpod.io/).
2.  Click "Login" and sign up using your **GitHub account**. This is important, as Gitpod works by connecting directly to GitHub repositories.

#### Student Plan
Gitpod offers a generous free plan for students. Be sure to explore this on their website after you've signed up.

### Step 2: Open Our Class Project in Gitpod

This is the magic part. To launch a ready-to-code environment for our class, you just need to visit a special URL.

1.  The URL for our class's main GitHub repository is: **{{< meta repository_url >}}**

2.  To open this project in Gitpod, simply prefix the URL with `gitpod.io/#`. The full link you need to open in your browser is:

    <a href="https://gitpod.io/#{{< meta repository_url >}}" target="_blank">gitpod.io/#{{< meta repository_url >}}</a>

    Clicking the link above will launch your environment.

That's it! Gitpod will now:
-   Create a new, personal copy of the class project for you.
-   Install all the required software (Python, Quarto, etc.).
-   Launch a complete development environment, including the VS Code editor, right in your browser.

## Using Gitpod

-   The editor you see is a full version of VS Code.
-   A terminal is available at the bottom of the screen. All the `python3`, `pip`, and `quarto` commands will work there.
-   When you preview a Quarto document, Gitpod will automatically handle the networking and show you the rendered page in a new browser tab.

## Summary

If you choose this path, you are all set! You have Python, an editor, and all the tools you need. You can now skip ahead to the tutorial on **[Setting Up Git & GitHub](./06_setting_up_git_and_github.qmd)** to learn how to save your work.
