## The Most Important Rule: It's OK to Get Stuck

Technology changes constantly. Your computer is different from your classmates'. This guide is a map of a territory that is always shifting. The map is good, but you *will* find a new river or a fallen tree.

**Encountering an error is a normal and expected part of this process.**

Finding your own way around these obstacles is the *real* skill you are learning here. Please do not skip the next tutorial, **"How to Get Help,"** as it's the most crucial part of this entire setup.
