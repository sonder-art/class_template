## Understanding Forking and Cloning

Before we act, let's understand these two key ideas.

-   **Forking:** This happens entirely on the GitHub website. You find a project that belongs to someone else (like the main class project) and click the "Fork" button. This creates an **exact copy** of that project under your own GitHub account. It's now *your* repository. You can do anything you want with it, and your changes will not affect the original.

-   **Cloning:** This is the process of downloading a repository from GitHub.com onto your own computer. You "clone" your fork, creating a local copy that you can edit with Cursor.

The full workflow is:
**Fork** the instructor's repository on GitHub -> **Clone** your new repository from GitHub to your computer.

## Step 1: Forking the Class Repository

Let's create your personal copy on GitHub.

1.  Navigate to the main GitHub page for our class template. The URL is in the syllabus and also here: **{{< meta repository_url >}}**
2.  In the top-right corner of the page, find the button that shows a fork icon and the word **"Fork"**. Click it.
3.  A new page titled "Create a new fork" will appear.
    -   **Owner:** Make sure your GitHub username is selected.
    -   **Repository name:** You can keep the default name or change it. `{{< meta course_code >}}-notes` is a good choice.
    -   Leave all other options as they are.
4.  Click the green **"Create fork"** button at the bottom.
5.  After a few seconds, you will be taken to a new page. **Look at the top-left corner.** It should now say `[your-username] / [repository-name]`. This confirms you are now looking at *your* personal copy.

## Step 2: Cloning Your Fork to Your Computer

Now we bring that repository down from the cloud to your local machine.

1.  Make sure you are on the main page of **your forked repository** on GitHub.
2.  Look for a big, green button on the right side of the page that says **"< > Code"**. Click it.
3.  A dropdown box will appear. You will see three tabs at the top: "HTTPS", "SSH", and "GitHub CLI". Make sure the **"SSH"** tab is selected. It should have a blue line under it.
4.  Below the tabs, you will see a piece of text that starts with `git@github.com:...`. To the right of this text is a small icon of two overlapping squares. This is the **Copy button**. Click it to copy the entire SSH URL to your clipboard.
5.  Now, open your terminal application (Terminal on Mac, PowerShell on Windows, or your Linux/WSL terminal).
6.  You need to decide where you want to store your schoolwork. A good place is a `Documents` folder. Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate there.

    ```bash
    # This command moves you into your Documents folder.
    cd Documents
    ```

7.  Now, use the `git clone` command and paste the URL you copied from GitHub.

    ```bash
    # The command is "git clone" followed by the pasted URL
    git clone [paste the URL you copied here]
    ```
    Your full command will look something like this:
    `git clone git@github.com:[your-username]/{{< meta course_code >}}-notes.git`
8.  Press **Enter**. You will see some text as Git downloads the repository to your computer.

You're done! A new folder with your repository's name now exists in your `Documents` folder. In the next step, we will open it with Cursor and test it.
