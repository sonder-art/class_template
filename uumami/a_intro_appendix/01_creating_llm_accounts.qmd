## üìç Where You Are

This is Step 1 of the setup process. You're creating accounts for AI tools that will help you throughout the course.

## Your Team of AI Assistants

Modern programming and data analysis are rarely done alone. In the past, you might have had to rely on a textbook or a single instructor. Today, you have access to a suite of powerful AI assistants that are like having a team of experts and a massive, interactive library available to you 24/7.

We are having you sign up for several because, just like people, each AI has different strengths. You will learn which one to ask for different types of questions.
