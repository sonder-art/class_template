### Your Goals for This Section
- **Understand what Quarto is** and its role as our publishing tool.
- **Install the Quarto command-line tool**.
- **Run a final "smoke test"** to ensure your entire local environment is working together perfectly.

## The Final Piece: What is Quarto?

::: {.definition title="What is Quarto? (Your Personal Publishing House)"}
**Quarto** is a tool that takes simple text files containing your notes and code and turns them into beautiful, professional documents.

Think of it as your personal publishing house. You provide the manuscript (a simple `.qmd` file with text and Python code), and the Quarto engine formats it, runs the code, includes the output (like charts and tables), and produces a polished final product.

With Quarto, you can turn a single source file into dozens of formats, including:
- A complete, interactive website (like the one you're reading!)
- A PDF for a formal report
- A PowerPoint-style presentation
- An e-book
:::

It's the tool that brings all our workâ€”text, code, and resultsâ€”together.

## Step 1: Install Quarto

Choose the tab for your operating system. Using a package manager is recommended.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install quarto
```

### Windows (Winget)
Open **PowerShell** as an administrator and run:
```bash
winget install Quarto.Quarto
```

### Linux (Installer)
We recommend the official installer for Linux.
1.  Go to the [Official Quarto Downloads Page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and download the `.deb` file for Debian/Ubuntu.
2.  In your terminal, navigate to your `Downloads` folder and run the installation command (your version number may be different):
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    sudo dpkg -i quarto-*-linux-amd64.deb
    ```
:::

To verify it's installed, open a **new** terminal and run `quarto --version`. You should see a version number.

## Step 2: The Smoke Test - Verifying Your Full Setup

This final test confirms that your entire toolchain works together: Cursor, Git, Python, and Quarto. We will render the template project you cloned to make sure everything is configured correctly.

### 1. Open the Project in Cursor
- Open your terminal (Ubuntu/WSL, or Terminal on Mac).
- Navigate to the project folder you cloned in the last step.
    ```bash
    # For example, if you cloned it into your Documents folder
    cd Documents/cs101-notes 
    ```
- Once you are inside the project folder, open it in Cursor.
    ```bash
    cursor .
    ```
- The Cursor application will launch with all the project files in the File Explorer on the left.

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Your project needs certain Python libraries to run the code embedded in the documents. The `requirements.txt` file lists them.

- Inside Cursor, open the built-in terminal panel (``Ctrl+` ``).
- Run the following command to install everything listed in the requirements file for the student template.
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r students/_template/requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Preview the Project Website
This is the universal workflow you will use for **all** Quarto projects.

- In the Cursor terminal, navigate into the student project directory:
    ```bash
    cd students/_template
    ```
- Run the universal preview command:
    ```bash
    quarto preview
    ```
- A local web server will start. In your terminal, you will see a line that says `Listening on http://localhost:....`. **Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click that link.**
- A new tab should open in your web browser showing a live preview of the student template website.

::: {.definition title="What is `localhost`?"}
`localhost` is a special network name that always means "this computer." When your browser visits a `localhost` URL, it's not fetching a website from the internet. It is talking directly to the temporary web server that Quarto is running on your machine. This lets you see a perfect preview of your site without having to upload it anywhere first.
:::

To stop the preview server, go back to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl+C`.

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

If you can successfully preview the project website, you have mastered the fundamental Quarto workflow and **your environment is perfectly configured!** You have a professional-grade setup for the entire course and for any future projects you can dream of.
