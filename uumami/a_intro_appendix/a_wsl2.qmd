### Your Goals for This Section
- **Understand what WSL2 is** and why it's the best tool for this course on Windows.
- **Install WSL2** on your computer with a single command.
- **Learn the essential concepts:** how to use it, where to store your files, and how it's different from PowerShell.
:::


## What is WSL2? The "Why"

Imagine your Windows computer is a house. Most of the time, you live in the "Windows" part of the house. But for data science and programming, the best tools are often built for a different operating system called **Linux**.

**WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is like building a perfect, fully-equipped workshop inside your Windows house.

-   **Without WSL2:** It's like trying to do complex woodworking in your kitchen. You can make it work, but the tools aren't quite right, you might make a mess, and things don't always fit together.
-   **With WSL2:** You have a dedicated space (Linux) with all the right professional tools, set up exactly as they are meant to be used. When you're done, you just leave the workshop and you're back in your regular Windows house.

For this course, using WSL2 is strongly recommended because it makes your Windows machine behave just like a Mac or a Linux computer, which are the standard environments for developers. This avoids countless small issues with software compatibility.

## A Modern Approach: Using AI as Your WSL2 Co-Pilot

Installing and understanding WSL2 is more complex than a normal application because it fundamentally changes how you interact with your computer. This makes it the most important place to practice using your AI assistant as a patient tutor to guide you through the **why, how, and what now?**

### Phase 1: Understand the "Why"

First, ask a broad question to understand the purpose of this tool.

::: {.prompt title="Conceptual Understanding Prompt"}
"I am a beginner programmer taking a course that requires me to use something called **WSL2** on my Windows 11 machine. Can you explain in simple terms what WSL2 is, and why it's recommended over just using the normal Windows PowerShell terminal?"
:::

### Phase 2: Get the Installation Plan

Once you understand the 'why', ask for the 'how'.

::: {.prompt title="Installation Plan Prompt"}
"Okay, I want to install WSL2 with the **Ubuntu** distribution on my Windows 11 computer. Can you give me the simplest, most direct, step-by-step instructions to do this?"
:::

### Phase 3: Understand the Nuances of Usage (Most Important Step!)

This is the most critical part of learning WSL2. After it's installed, a beginner is often left wondering, "Now what?" Proactively ask the AI to clarify the common points of confusion.

::: {.prompt title="Detailed Usage Prompt"}
"I have just successfully installed WSL2 and Ubuntu. I am a complete beginner and have some questions about how to actually use it:

1.  **How do I 'enter' WSL2?** Is the 'Ubuntu' app in my Start Menu the right thing to open? How do I know if my terminal is a Linux terminal or a Windows PowerShell?
2.  **Where do I store my files?** This is the most confusing part. Should I put my class project folders in my normal `C:\Users\MyName\Documents` folder, or somewhere else? Can I access my Windows files from inside Linux? How?
3.  **How do I keep it updated?** Is there a command I should run periodically to make sure the Linux part of my system is up-to-date?"
:::

The answers to these questions are the key to using WSL2 successfully.

### Phase 4: Execute and Debug

With a clear understanding of the what, how, and why, you are now ready to follow the installation steps.

1.  **Verify First:** Compare the AI's installation plan with the steps below in this guide. They should be nearly identical. If they differ, **trust this guide**.
2.  **Execute:** Follow the steps to install, restart, and set up your Linux user.
3.  **Debug If Needed:** If a step fails, use the debugging prompt pattern, providing the goal, the command, and the exact error.

## Step 1: Install WSL2 (It's Easier Than You Think)

Microsoft has made this incredibly simple. You only need one command.

1.  **Open PowerShell as an Administrator.**
    -   Press the `Windows` key.
    -   Type `PowerShell`.
    -   Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and choose **"Run as Administrator"**. You must run as an administrator for this to work.

2.  **Run the Installation Command.**
    -   Copy and paste the following command into the PowerShell window and press `Enter`:

    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

    ::: {.callout-note title="What does this command do?"}
    This one command tells Windows to:
    1.  Enable all the necessary features for WSL.
    2.  Download and install the WSL system itself.
    3.  Download and install the **Ubuntu** distribution of Linux (which is the one we'll use).
    :::

3.  **Restart Your Computer.**
    -   After the command finishes, it will likely tell you to restart your computer. Please do so to complete the installation.

4.  **Set Up Your Linux Account.**
    -   After restarting, an **Ubuntu** terminal window should open automatically. If it doesn't, just open the "Ubuntu" app from your Start Menu.
    -   It will ask you to create a **username** and **password**.

    ::: {.callout-warning title="Important: Your Linux Identity"}
    -   This username and password are for your **Linux environment only**. They have no connection to your Windows login.
    -   Choose a simple, lowercase username (e.g., your first name).
    -   When you type your password, **you will not see any characters or asterisks**. This is a standard security feature in Linux. Just type your password and press `Enter`.
    :::

## Step 2: How to Use WSL2 - The Core Concepts

This is the most important part to understand. Getting this right will save you a lot of headaches.

### When Am I "In" WSL?

Think of it like an app. When you want to do course work, you "enter" your Linux workshop.

-   **To start working:** Press the `Windows` key and open the **Ubuntu** app.
-   **That's it.** You are now inside your Linux terminal. Any command you type here runs in Linux, not Windows. This is where you will do all your coding, run Python, and use Git.

### PowerShell vs. Ubuntu Terminal: What's the Difference?

-   **PowerShell:** The terminal for managing **Windows**.
-   **Ubuntu Terminal:** The terminal for managing **Linux** (your WSL environment).

**For this course, you should always open and use the Ubuntu terminal.**

### The Golden Rule: Where to Store Your Files

This is the most common point of confusion. Because you have two "worlds" (Windows and Linux), you have two separate file systems.

::: {.callout-tip title="The Golden Rule of WSL2 File Storage"}
**ALWAYS store your project files inside the Linux file system.**
:::

Why? It's much, much faster, and it avoids file permission errors that can be very confusing to fix.

#### How to Find Your Linux Files from Windows

Your Linux files are not in `C:\Users\YourName`. They live in a special, separate place.

1.  Open the **Windows File Explorer** (the yellow folder icon).
2.  In the address bar at the top, type `\\wsl$` and press `Enter`.
3.  You will see a folder named `Ubuntu`. Double-click it.
4.  Inside, you'll see a folder named `home`, and inside that, a folder with your Linux username. **This is your Linux home directory.**

**Recommendation:** Right-click on your Linux user folder (the one with your username) and select **"Pin to Quick access"** from the context menu. This will add a shortcut to your Linux files directly to the left-hand sidebar of your File Explorer for easy access.

#### Can I See My Windows Files from Linux?

Yes. Your Windows `C:\` drive is available inside your Ubuntu terminal at the path `/mnt/c`.

You can see it by typing `ls /mnt/c` in your Ubuntu terminal.

::: {.callout-warning title="Avoid Working Here!"}
While you *can* see your Windows files, you should **not** store or edit your project files from here. Always work in your Linux home directory (`/home/your-linux-username`).
:::

## Step 3: Post-Installation - Keep Your Linux Healthy

Just like Windows, your Linux "workshop" needs to be updated occasionally to get the latest security patches and software updates.

Open your **Ubuntu terminal** and run this single command. It might ask for the Linux password you created earlier.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

::: {.definition title="What do these commands mean?"}
- `sudo`: "Super User Do". This is like "Run as Administrator" for Linux. It gives the command permission to make system-wide changes.
- `apt update`: This doesn't install anything. It just asks Linux to update its list of what new software is available.
- `&&`: This is a shortcut that means "if the first command was successful, then run the next command."
- `apt upgrade -y`: This is the command that actually installs the updates. The `-y` automatically says "yes" to any questions.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="A Critical Rule for All Future Steps"}
From this point forward, **your Ubuntu terminal is your primary development environment.**

When you proceed to the next guides to install Python, Git, and Quarto, you must always follow the instructions labeled **Linux (Ubuntu/WSL)**.

Do not use the instructions for "Windows (Direct)" or "Windows (PowerShell)". All your development tools must be installed *inside* the Linux world to work together correctly.
:::

Congratulations! Your professional development environment is now set up and ready for the entire course.
