## Installing the Python Engine

Python is the programming language we will use for almost everything in this course. It's the engine that powers our data analysis, visualization, and more. `pip` is the tool we use to install new parts for that engine.

In this guide, you will be using the **terminal** (also called the **command line** or **shell**). This is a text-based way to interact with your computer.

-   **Windows:** Open the Ubuntu, Debian, or other Linux app you installed with WSL.
-   **macOS:** Open the "Terminal" app.
-   **Linux:** Open the "Terminal" or "Console" app.

## Step 1: Check if Python is Already Installed

Many systems come with Python pre-installed. Let's check. Type this command into your terminal and press Enter:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see a version number like `Python 3.8.10` or higher, you are likely in good shape and can skip to **Step 3**. If you see an error or a version older than 3.8, proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Choose Your Operating System for Installation

Click on the tab below that matches your computer's operating system.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows (WSL2 - Recommended)

This is the most robust and reliable way to run Python on Windows for data science.

1.  **Prerequisite:** This method requires the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). If you have not installed it, please follow the [Official Microsoft WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and choose **Ubuntu**.
2.  **Update Package Lists:** In your Ubuntu terminal, run this command to make sure you have the latest list of available software.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3.  **Install Python and Tools:** This command installs Python, its package manager (`pip`), and tools for creating virtual environments (`venv`).

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
    ```

### macOS (Recommended)

The best way to manage software like Python on a Mac is with a package manager called Homebrew.

1.  **Install Homebrew:** If you don't have it, open your Terminal app and paste the single command from the official [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).
2.  **Install Python:** Once Homebrew is installed, run this simple command:

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
    Homebrew will handle all the details for you.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Most Linux systems have Python, but this ensures you have all the necessary supporting packages.

1.  **Update Package Lists:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install Python and Tools:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
    ```

### Windows (Direct - Not Recommended)

::: {.callout-warning}
#### Proceed with Caution
This method can be difficult because of a system setting called `PATH`. Small mistakes can make it hard for your computer to find the `python` command. We strongly recommend the WSL2 method.
:::

1.  Go to the official [Python website's download page for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2.  Download the latest stable installer (e.g., "Windows installer (64-bit)").
3.  Run the installer. **This is the most important step:** On the very first screen of the installer, you MUST check the box at the bottom that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"**. If you miss this step, it will be very difficult to fix.

:::

## Step 3: Verify Your Installation

Let's do a final check. Close and reopen your terminal, then run these two commands separately:

```bash
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

You should see version numbers for both. If you do, congratulations! Your engine is ready.

## Troubleshooting & Self-Help

::: {.callout-caution}
### Common Problems

-   **Problem:** After installing, the `python3` command gives a "command not found" error.
-   **Golden Prompt for your AI:** "I have just installed Python on `[My OS name]`. When I open a new terminal and type `python3 --version`, I get a 'command not found' error. How can I check if Python was correctly added to my system's PATH variable, and what are the steps to add it manually?"
