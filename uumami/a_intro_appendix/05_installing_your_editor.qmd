## Your Digital Workshop: What is a Code Editor?

A code editor is your most important tool. It's like a word processor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) but designed specifically for writing code. It understands the syntax of programming languages, helping you with color-coding, formatting, and finding errors.

More advanced editors like **Cursor** are often called **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** because they integrate many tools into one application. Instead of just being a text editor, Cursor includes:

-   A file browser for your project.
-   A terminal to run commands.
-   Built-in AI assistants to help you code.
-   Integration with tools like Git and GitHub.

This lets you do all your work in a single, organized window.

### How Cursor Helps You
Cursor is a special version of the world's most popular editor (VS Code) that comes with powerful AI features built-in. Think of it as an editor with a team of AI assistants ready to help you write, debug, and understand code much faster. Since this course encourages using AI as a partner, Cursor is the perfect tool for the job.

## Step 1: Install Cursor

We recommend using your system's package manager from the terminal, as it's faster and easier to manage. Choose the tab for your operating system.

### macOS

1.  **Prerequisite:** You need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the package manager for macOS. If you don't have it, open your Terminal app and paste the single command from their website to install it.
2.  **Install Cursor:** Run this simple command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew install --cask cursor
    ```
    Homebrew will handle the download and installation for you.

### Windows

1.  **Prerequisite:** This uses the built-in `winget` package manager. It should be available on all modern Windows systems.
2.  **Install Cursor:** Open **PowerShell** (not Command Prompt) and run:

    ```bash
    winget install Anysphere.Cursor
    ```

### Linux (WSL & Desktop)

Installing GUI applications on Linux can sometimes be complex. The most reliable method for beginners is to download the AppImage directly.

1.  Go to the [official Cursor website](https://cursor.sh/) and download the AppImage file.
2.  Open your terminal and go to your `Downloads` folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

3.  Make the file you downloaded executable (replace the filename if yours is different):

    ```bash
    chmod +x Cursor-*.AppImage
    ```

4.  Now, you can run it directly:

    ```bash
    ./Cursor-*.AppImage --no-sandbox
    ```
    You may also want to move this file to a more permanent location, like `/opt/`, and create a desktop entry, but for now, running it from `Downloads` is fine.

## Step 2: How to Use Cursor - The Basics

Before installing extensions, let's get familiar with the interface.

### Opening a Project Folder
In software development, you don't open individual files; you open the entire project **folder**. This lets the editor see all the files at once, which is critical for its features to work correctly.

After you clone your project in a later step, you will open it like this:

1.  Launch the Cursor application.
2.  Go to the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the screen.
3.  Click "Open Folder..."
4.  Navigate to your project folder (e.g., `Documents/{{< meta course_code >}}-notes`) and click "Open".

### The Main UI Components
When you open a project, you'll see three main areas:

1.  **File Explorer (Left):** This is a tree view of all the files and folders in your project. You can click on any file here to open it for editing.
2.  **Editor Pane (Center):** This is where your files open. You can have multiple files open in different tabs. This is where you will write your code and notes.
3.  **Terminal Panel (Bottom):** This is a command line, just like the "Terminal" or "PowerShell" app, but built directly into Cursor. You can open it by pressing ``Ctrl+` `` (the backtick key, usually next to the `1` key) or by going to the "Terminal" > "New Terminal" menu. We will use this constantly.

## Step 3: Install Essential Extensions

Extensions add new features to your editor. We need to install two to support our work.

1.  Open the Cursor application.
2.  On the left-hand side, there is a vertical bar of icons. Click the one that looks like a set of blocks (the Extensions view).
3.  In the search bar, search for and install these two extensions:

    -   **Python** (by Microsoft): Core support for the Python language.
    -   **Quarto** (by Quarto): Syntax highlighting and a "Render" button for our documents.

## Step 4: Special Instructions for WSL on Windows

If you are using Windows with WSL, you need one more crucial extension to connect Cursor to your Linux environment.

1.  In the Extensions view, search for `WSL` and install the extension from **Microsoft**.
2.  **Crucially**, you must open your projects from the Ubuntu/Linux terminal, not from Windows PowerShell.

    -   Open your Ubuntu terminal.
    -   Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/project`).
    -   Type `cursor .` and press Enter. The `.` is a shortcut that means "this current folder". This will open the project in Cursor, correctly connected to your Linux environment.

## What's Next?

You now have your professional workshop set up. The next step is to install the tools for saving and sharing your work: Git and GitHub.
