## Your Digital Workshop

::: {.definition title="What is a Code Editor?"}
A code editor is your digital workshop, your primary tool for creating. It's like a word processor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) but supercharged for writing code. It understands programming languages, helping you with color-coding, auto-completion, and finding errors.

We use **Cursor**, a special version of the world's most popular editor (VS Code) that has powerful AI features built right in. It integrates everything you need into one window: a file browser, a terminal to run commands, and AI assistants to help you code.

## A Modern Approach: Using AI as Your Installation Guide

Software and installation methods change quickly. While this guide provides reliable, step-by-step instructions, it's also a perfect opportunity to practice a critical skill: using an AI assistant as your primary guide, with our documentation as your "safety net" to verify the AI's output.

```{mermaid}

Instead of immediately following the steps below, try this first. Open your AI assistant (like Cursor or ChatGPT) and give it a detailed, high-quality prompt based on the R-C-T framework.

::: {.prompt title="Your First Prompt: Installing Cursor"}
You are an expert technical assistant who provides clear, step-by-step instructions for beginners.

I am using **[Your Operating System: e.g., macOS Sonoma, Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04]**.

I want to install the code editor **Cursor**. If possible, I'd prefer to use my operating system's standard package manager (like Homebrew on Mac, Winget on Windows, or apt on Linux).

Please provide me with a complete, step-by-step guide to do this. For each step that requires a terminal command, show the exact command and briefly explain what it does.
:::

#### How to Evaluate the AI's Answer

Once the AI gives you a response, your job is to be the project manager, not just a follower.

1.  **Compare with this Guide:** Read the AI's suggestion. Now, scroll down and look at the installation instructions in this guide for your operating system. Do they match?
    *   If **yes**, you've successfully used AI to get a correct answer! You can proceed with confidence.
    *   If **no**, the AI might be outdated or suggesting a different method. For this course, it's best to **trust the instructions written in this guide**.

2.  **What If You Get an Error?** This will happen eventually, and it's a great learning moment. Use the AI as your debugger.

    ::: {.prompt title="Follow-up Prompt: Debugging an Error"}
    I followed your instructions, but Step [Number] failed.

    **The command I ran was:**
    `[The exact command you typed]`

    **The error message I received was:**
    `[The exact error message you saw]`

    Can you explain what this error means and give me the corrected command?
    :::

This processâ€”asking, verifying with documentation, and asking again with errorsâ€”is the core workflow of a modern developer. By trying it now, you are building one of the most valuable skills for your career.


## Step 1: Install Cursor

We recommend using your system's package manager from the terminal, as it's the fastest and most reliable way to install and update software. Choose the tab for your operating system.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS (Homebrew)

1.  **Requirement:** You need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the package manager for macOS. If you didn't install it in the Python step, open your Terminal and follow the instructions on their website.
2.  **Install Cursor:** Run this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew install --cask cursor
    ```

### Windows (Winget)

1.  **Requirement:** This uses the built-in `winget` package manager, which is standard on modern Windows.
2.  **Install Cursor:** Open **PowerShell** as an administrator and run:

    ```bash
    winget install Anysphere.Cursor
    ```

### Linux (AppImage)

The most universal method for Linux is using the AppImage.

1.  Go to the [official Cursor website](https://cursor.sh/) and download the `.AppImage` file.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to your `Downloads` folder: `cd ~/Downloads`
3.  Make the file executable: `chmod +x Cursor-*.AppImage`
4.  Run it: `./Cursor-*.AppImage --no-sandbox`

:::

## Step 2: A Quick Tour of the Interface

In software development, you don't open individual files; you open the entire project **folder**. After you `clone` the class project in a later step, you will open that folder in Cursor.

When you do, you'll see three main areas:

1.  **File Explorer (Left):** A tree view of all the files and folders in your project. Click any file here to open it.
2.  **Editor Pane (Center):** This is where your files open in tabs. You'll do all your writing and editing here.
3.  **Terminal Panel (Bottom):** A command line built directly into Cursor. You can open it by pressing ``Ctrl+` `` (the backtick key, next to `1`) or from the "Terminal" > "New Terminal" menu. We will use this constantly.

## Step 3: Install Essential Extensions

Extensions add new features to your editor. We need two for our course.

1.  Open Cursor.
2.  Click the **Extensions** icon on the far-left vertical bar (it looks like four squares).
3.  In the search bar that appears, search for and install these two extensions:
    -   **Python** (by Microsoft): This provides core support for the Python language, including better auto-complete and error checking.
    -   **Quarto** (by Quarto): This gives you syntax highlighting and a helpful **"Render"** button for our documents.

## Step 4: Special Instructions for Windows (WSL) Users

If you are using Windows with WSL (the recommended setup), you must do one more thing to connect Cursor to your Linux environment.

1.  **Install the WSL extension:** In the Extensions view, search for `WSL` and install the extension from **Microsoft**.
2.  **Always open projects from the Ubuntu/Linux terminal.** This is the crucial part.

::: {.callout-tip title="The Correct Way to Open Projects on WSL"}
To make Cursor talk to your Linux files, you **must** launch it from the Linux (Ubuntu) terminal.

1.  Open your **Ubuntu** terminal (not PowerShell).
2.  Navigate to your project directory, e.g., `cd ~/Documents/your-project-folder`.
3.  From inside that folder, type the command `cursor .` and press Enter.

The `.` is a shortcut for "this current folder." This command opens the Cursor application correctly connected to your Linux environment, allowing it to see your files and use the Linux version of Python you installed.

You now have your digital workshop set up. The next step is to install the tools for creating your project's "time machine" and "online portfolio": Git and GitHub.
