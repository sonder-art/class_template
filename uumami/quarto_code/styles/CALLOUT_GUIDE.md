# Educational Callout Usage Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the 8 educational callout types in your Quarto documents. Each callout serves a specific pedagogical purpose and follows accessibility standards (6:1 contrast ratio minimum).

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Custom callouts require the `quarto-custom-callout` extension. See [Installation](#installation) section below.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Extension
Run this command in your project directory:
```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/custom-callout
```

### Step 2: Configure in _quarto.yml
The extension is already configured in this project's `_quarto.yml` with:
- ü§ñ **prompt** - AI prompting guidance (teal #00B894)
- ‚úèÔ∏è **exercise** - In-class activities (amber #F39C12)  
- üìù **homework** - Take-home assignments (coral #E17055)
- üéØ **objective** - Learning goals (blue #4A90E2)
- üìö **definition** - Formal definitions (purple #6C5CE7)

### Step 3: Add Filter to Format
The filter is automatically included via the global `_quarto.yml` configuration.

## The 8 Callout Types

Our callout system is organized into **4 semantic tiers** for clear educational structure:

### üìö **INFORMATION TIER** (Understanding)
- üìñ **`note`** - General information and context (built-in)
- üìö **`definition`** - Formal definitions and terminology (custom)

### üéØ **ACTION TIER** (Doing)  
- ‚úèÔ∏è **`exercise`** - In-class practice activities (custom)
- üìù **`homework`** - Take-home assignments (custom)
- ü§ñ **`prompt`** - AI/LLM prompting guidance (custom)

### üí° **ADVISORY TIER** (Guidance)
- ‚≠ê **`tip`** - Helpful advice and pro tips (built-in)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **`warning`** - Important cautions and alerts (built-in)

### üéì **META TIER** (Learning Structure)
- üéØ **`objective`** - Learning goals and outcomes (custom)

# Detailed Usage Guide

## üìñ Note Callouts (Built-in)
**Purpose**: Provide general information, context, or background knowledge.

**When to use**:
- Explaining concepts that aren't formal definitions
- Providing historical context
- Offering additional information that supports understanding

**Examples**:
```markdown

Git tracks changes by creating "snapshots" of your project at different points in time. Each snapshot is called a "commit."
:::
```

## üìö Definition Callouts (Custom)
**Purpose**: Present formal definitions, terminology, and key concepts.

**When to use**:
- Introducing new technical terms
- Providing formal definitions from academic sources
- Creating glossary-like references

**Examples**:
```markdown

:::
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Callouts (Built-in)
**Purpose**: Alert students to important cautions, common mistakes, and critical information.

**When to use**:
- Highlighting dangerous operations
- Pointing out common errors
- Explaining consequences of incorrect actions

**Examples**:
```markdown
::: {.callout-warning}
Be extremely careful with `rm -rf` commands. This permanently deletes files with no way to recover them.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Git Security"}
Never commit passwords, API keys, or personal data. Once committed, this information becomes part of your project's permanent history.
:::
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise Callouts (Custom)
**Purpose**: Present in-class practice activities and hands-on tasks.

**When to use**:
- Interactive coding exercises
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Activities that reinforce current lesson content

**Examples**:
```markdown
::: {.exercise}
**Practice: Your First Python Script**

1. Create a new file called `hello.py`
2. Add this code: `print("Hello, World!")`
3. Run it with `python3 hello.py`
4. Modify the message to include your name
:::

::: {.exercise title="Git Practice"}
Try this sequence:
1. `git status` - Check current state
2. `git add .` - Stage all changes  
3. `git commit -m "Your message"`
4. `git log --oneline` - See history
:::
```

# Best Practices

## Content Guidelines
- **Keep focused**: Each callout should have one clear purpose
- **Use appropriate length**: Tips are short, exercises can be longer
- **Write clearly**: Avoid jargon unless defined elsewhere
- **Test examples**: Ensure all code and instructions work

## Syntax Guidelines
- **Built-in callouts**: Use `.callout-type` format (note, tip, warning, important, caution)
- **Custom callouts**: Use `.type` format (prompt, exercise, homework, objective, definition)
- **Always test**: Render your document to verify callouts display correctly

## Accessibility
- ‚úÖ All callouts automatically meet 6:1 contrast ratio
- ‚úÖ Font sizes optimized for classroom presentations  
- ‚úÖ Icons and colors work across all themes
- ‚úÖ Content structure supports screen readers

## Common Patterns

### Lesson Structure
```markdown
::: {.objective}
Today's goals...
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Background information...
:::

::: {.definition}
Key terms...
:::

::: {.exercise}
Practice activity...
:::

::: {.homework}
Assignment for next week...
:::
```

### AI-Enhanced Learning
```markdown
::: {.prompt}
Try this prompt with your AI assistant...
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
When the AI response isn't clear, ask follow-up questions...
:::

::: {.exercise}  
Practice using the prompt above...
:::
```

# Theme Compatibility

All callouts work consistently across themes:
- **Evangelion**: Dark sci-fi with high contrast
- **Cyberpunk**: Neon colors with maintained readability  
- **Academic**: Professional traditional styling
- **Custom themes**: Automatically inherit your color palette

The system ensures educational content remains accessible and effective regardless of visual styling.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Extension Not Working
If custom callouts aren't rendering properly:

1. **Check installation**: Run `quarto add coatless-quarto/custom-callout`
2. **Verify configuration**: Ensure `_quarto.yml` includes the filter
3. **Test syntax**: Use `.prompt` not `.callout-prompt`
4. **Re-render**: Run `quarto render` to refresh

## Styling Issues
- Custom callouts inherit theme colors automatically
- The extension handles icons and structure
- Your CSS should focus on general improvements, not custom callout specifics
