## üß≠ Guiding Principles & Decision Matrix  
*Summarizing the philosophy from `core.md` so every new task aligns with the framework's spirit.*

### Core Tenets
1. **Keep the root minimal & friendly** ‚Äì only high-level control files live at top level (e.g., `dna.yml`, `LICENSE`).  
2. **Professor as source-of-truth** ‚Äì all course assets live under `/professor`; students never edit outside their own folder.  
3. **Automation first** ‚Äì anything that can be generated *will* be generated (configs, indices, nav, etc.).  
4. **Theme vs. Framework separation** ‚Äì functional logic in `framework_code/components`, aesthetics in `framework_code/themes/<theme>`.  
5. **Human-friendly overrides** ‚Äì day-to-day adjustments happen in `professor/config.yml`; framework/CI switches stay in `dna.yml`.
6. **Self-contained rendering** ‚Äì each directory renders independently using only local configuration files.
7. **Framework-only operations** ‚Äì all file operations go through framework scripts, no manual copying/symlinking.

### Configuration File Hierarchy (CORRECTED)
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Clear separation between meta-process control and rendering preferences.

| File | Purpose | Scope | Example Content |
|------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| `dna.yml` | Meta-process control | Repository-wide | `sync_mode`, CI/CD flags, operational settings |
| `config.yml` | Rendering preferences | Per-directory | Theme selection, visual settings, Hugo sources |
| `course.yml` | Class metadata | Per-directory | Course info, professor contact, branding |

**KEY RULE**: `dna.yml` NEVER contains rendering preferences. Each directory is self-contained for rendering.

### Where Should a New File Live?
| Need | Location | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Framework constant / CI switch | `dna.yml` | Repo-wide automation toggle |
| Visual or UX option | `professor/config.yml` | Per-class preference, easy for instructors |
| Global asset (shared across themes) | `framework_code/assets/` | Avoid duplication |
| Theme-specific CSS/JS | `framework_code/themes/<theme>/css/` | Encapsulated styling |
| Reusable logic/component | `framework_code/components/` | Cross-theme, cross-site reuse |
| Build/utility script | `framework_code/scripts/` | Centralized tooling |
| Auto-generated output | `framework_code/hugo_generated/` | Never touched by humans |
| Course content | `class_notes/`, `framework_tutorials/`, etc. | Structured learning materials |

### Student Operations
| Operation | Method | Frequency | Manual? |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Initial setup | `students/start.sh` | Once | Framework script |
| Framework updates | `sync_student.py` | Regular | Framework script |
| Content updates | `sync_student.py` | Regular | Framework script |
| Manual operations | **NEVER** | - | Framework handles all |
